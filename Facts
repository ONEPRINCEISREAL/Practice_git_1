The term "DevOps" was actually an accidental invention born from a character limit.

In 2009, a Belgian consultant named Patrick Debois organized a conference in Ghent called "DevOpsDays". 
When people started tweeting about the event on Twitter, the original hashtag #DevOpsDays was considered too long, so users shortened it to just #DevOps.
The abbreviated name stuck, and it eventually became the standard term for the entire industry movement.
